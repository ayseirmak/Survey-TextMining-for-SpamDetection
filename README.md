# Survey on the Use of Text Mining Techniques in Spam Detection
This study investigates the use of text mining techniques in spam detection. The study summarises the objectives, text pre-processing, feature extraction and classification methods, the datasets used, the results obtained and the findings of the studies conducted in the detection of comment spam, email spam and SMS spam in social network platforms. 
As a result of the studies, it can be seen that three different feature extraction approaches, namely behavioural, linguistic and semantic, are preferred in spam detection. In text mining applications that started in the 2000s, semantic features have come to the fore in recent years and studies have shifted towards natural language processing. Text mining techniques continue to have the potential to provide cost-effective results for specific purposes with increasingly accessible high quality datasets and hybrid applications, and to support technologies such as information extraction and natural language processing.
Text Mining Process
In the literature, the text mining process is typically shown as follows.(Maheswari, 2015)

Due to its cross-domain nature, it is not easy to draw the boundaries of text mining very sharply (Pasin, 2018).

## Evaluation and Conclusion of The Study
It has been observed that three different feature extraction approaches, namely behavioural, linguistic and semantic, are preferred in spam detection. It can be seen that linguistic feature extraction was preferred between 2008 and 2015, behavioural and semantic feature extraction (regular expressions) (with rule-based models) was preferred between 2011 and 2018, and NLP techniques started to be used more intensively in semantic feature extraction in studies after 2018. In terms of the classification algorithms used, in parallel with the developments in feature extraction approaches, machine learning and rule-based algorithms were used more intensively between 2008 and 2011, followed by hybrid and deep learning algorithms. This study focuses on the use of text mining techniques, and some studies using deep learning models and natural language processing techniques are included in the review in order to assess the topic holistically. An analysis of the datasets used in the studies shows that real spam data was difficult to access before 2012, and that spam data generated using the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform is easier to distinguish than real spam data. In text mining applications that started in the 2000s, semantic features have come to the fore in recent years and studies have shifted towards natural language processing.
